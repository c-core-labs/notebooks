    "After playing around with attempting to download the data directly in csv form, it seems the gc.ca website expects a PHP session token. Without it, we get redirected to the login page. By opening the browser developer tools (ctrl-shift-i in chrome) and clicking the `network` tab, we can see the actuall http requests made by the website. If we then click the `agree` button in the login page, we see a POST request to `disclaimer_e.html` in the network tab. Right-clicking this, we can select `copy as fetch` which copies into our clipboard the following:\n",
